Example code: 

Google calendar implementation code using Nylas API:
Using Nylas, I listed the events through events.list which grabs all of the calendars for each user and displays the events. Then in the views folder for calendar, I embeded a frame of the user's Google Calendar and imported it via the user's Gmail account.

Next steps:

Adding events/tasks to Google Calendar and allowing users to customize their calendars and profiles more.
